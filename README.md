Hey, Welcome to my personal website!

# ⭐About me

I am a final-year PhD candidate from the College of Economics and Management at Nanjing Agricultural University in China. Now, I am also a visiting researcher work at Institute of Food and Reseource Economics (ILR) at The University of Bonn in Germany. 

My research field incldues International Trade, International Finance, Empirical Microeconomics, Development Economics, Chinese Economy. My research interests focus on the Agri-product trade and policy analysis, frim international activity and market power and climate risk and corporate finance.

I will be on the job market in 2026-2027 and available for interviews. You can find my CV and bio in Chinese here. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research!

**1. Does climate risk disclosure affect stock liquidity?**  
*with Yilan Chen and Dehua Xia*  

📖 *Research in International Business and Finance*, 2025  

**Highlights**
- Climate risk disclosure enhances stock liquidity.
- Opportunity and physical risk disclosures mainly affect current stock liquidity.
- Regulatory risk disclosures have a stronger impact on future stock liquidity.
- Firms with higher transparency and stronger climate commitments amplify these positive effects.

**Summary** 

This study empirically examines the effects of climate risk disclosure on stock liquidity at the firm-quarter level. Using panel data from 5161 U.S. listed firms from 2007 to 2022, we employ a two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model to estimate the causal impact of firm-level climate risk disclosure on stock liquidity. Our findings reveal that climate risk disclosure significantly enhances stock liquidity in the current and subsequent quarters. These results remain robust across various model specifications, sample variations, and periods. Specifically, disclosures related to opportunity and physical risks have a more pronounced effect on current stock liquidity, while regulatory risk disclosures exert a more substantial influence on future stock liquidity. Furthermore, firms with greater information transparency and proactive commitment to climate change amplify the positive effects of climate risk disclosure on stock liquidity. These findings highlight the critical role of corporate climate risk disclosure in shaping market dynamics and improving liquidity.

**2. Tax avoidance opportunity for multinational enterprises: effects of digitalized tax administration in China**
*with Yilan Chen*  

📖 *Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money*, 2025  

**Highlights**
- The asymmetric effects of DTA on tax avoidance by MNEs and domestic firms.
- OFDI breadth for MNEs and cross-border investment for domestic firms are mechanisms.
- The effects of DTA on MNEs’ tax avoidance vary across firm characteristics.
- MNEs adjust their cross-border tax avoidance approaches in response to DTA.

**Summary**

This study investigates the impact of digitalized tax administration (DTA) on multinational enterprises’ (MNEs’) tax avoidance, with a specific focus on outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) in tax havens. Using a quasi-natural experiment based on the implementation of Golden Tax Project III (GTP III) in China, we find that home country DTA significantly reduces the difference between nominal and effective tax rates for MNEs by 1.2%. This reduction is primarily driven by a contraction in OFDI breadth in tax havens, which restrains MNEs’ tax avoidance. We demonstrate an asymmetric effect wherein DTA does not significantly influence domestic firms’ tax avoidance, which is attributed to their ability to facilitate cross-regional investment. We also explore the various responses to cross-border tax avoidance approaches employed by MNEs to mitigate the adverse effects of DTA on corporate tax avoidance. Overall, our findings highlight the critical role of home country DTA in managing MNEs’ tax avoidance, particularly in the context of developing countries.

**3. Does agricultural factor misallocation hinder agricultural green production efficiency? Evidence from China**
*with Xiao Yang and Jiahong Qin* 

**📖 *Science of The Total Environment*, 2023 **

**Highlights**
- Systematic analysis between misallocation and agricultural green production efficiency.
- The Cobb Douglas production function is used to calculate the factor misallocation.
- Calculate agricultural green production efficiency index by MinDS super-efficiency model.
- Examine the spatial effect and depict the spatial change characteristics.

**Summary**

The sustainable development of agriculture is challenged by two major issues: increasing resource constraints and environmental pollution. Sustainable agricultural development is achievable by improving green total factor productivity from the perspective of resource allocation. To promote the green development of agriculture, this paper utilizes the SBM super-efficiency mode and thus calculates the agricultural resource misallocation index and agricultural green production efficiency index in China between 2001 and 2019. Furthermore, this paper discusses the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of agricultural green production efficiency, using a fixed model and spatial econometric models to estimate the influence effect of agricultural resource misallocation on green production efficiency. Below are the results. First, China's agricultural green total factor productivity is growing at an impressive rate, with high efficiency in the northeast, northwest, and southeast coastal areas and low efficiency in the central and inland areas. Second, agricultural capital misallocation, labor misallocation, and land misallocation all negatively impact agricultural green production efficiency. Accordingly, the misallocation of agricultural factors will hamper the growth of agricultural green production efficiency in this region and also in the surrounding areas. Third, the indirect impact on the own agricultural green production efficiency exceeds its direct impact on neighboring regions' efficiency. Fourth, the mechanisms are the upgrading of agricultural industry structure and green technology innovation. According to the findings, reducing resource misallocation can substantially enhance agricultural green productivity, which is an imperative step in addressing agricultural green production. Hence, policies should be formulated that highlight the regional allocation of agricultural production factors and green production-oriented concept of agricultural production. Also, the government should promote the transformation and upgrading of the agricultural industrial structure, as well as the application of green agricultural technologies.
